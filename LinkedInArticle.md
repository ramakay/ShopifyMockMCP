# From Hype to Hand-Crafted: Building a Shopify MCP Server That Actually Works (for Us)

**TL;DR:**

*   AI developer tools promise the world, but off-the-shelf MCP servers often lack safety, stability, or the specific features needed (especially for safe testing).
*   Building our own Shopify MCP server, centered around `mock.shop`, provides a crucial sandbox for risk-free development and accurate testing against specific API versions.
*   Navigating the journey involves real struggles (API churn, bugs, "why build this?" moments), but yields deep understanding and tailored control.
*   True 10x developer productivity comes from *intentionally* building or adapting tools (like incorporating `ToolAnnotations`) to fit your team's specific workflow and safety needs, not just grabbing the first available option.

Remember 2019? The A/B testing gold rush was peaking. Tools like Optimizely felt like magic wands, promising effortless conversion lifts. We dove in, configuring complex experiments, only to find ourselves tangled in flickering variations, debugging opaque execution logic, and spending more time managing the tool than reaping the benefits. It wasn't magic; it was hard work disguised as a shortcut. Fast forward to today, and the AI-driven developer tool landscape feels eerily similar. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges, promising seamless AI-IDE integration, and suddenly, directories overflow with "free" MCP servers for every platform imaginable. The allure is strong, but that 2019 feeling lingers.

We embarked on building our own Shopify MCP server, driven by a clear need: enabling AI assistants to safely interact with Shopify APIs for development tasks. The initial goal seemed straightforward – bridge the gap between the AI and the API.

> **"The initial promise of AI augmenting development is immense, but quickly confronts the messy reality of live systems. True acceleration requires not just connecting AI to APIs, but doing so with guardrails, context, and intentionality."**

Our core idea hinged on integrating `mock.shop`. Why? Because letting an AI loose on a live production store, even with the best intentions, felt like handing over the keys without checking the driver's license. `mock.shop` offered the perfect sandbox: a realistic environment for testing queries, mutations, and workflows without risking a single piece of real data. We wanted developers (and their AI partners) to iterate quickly and safely.

But the path wasn't smooth. Shopify's API landscape is a living entity, constantly evolving. We hit the versioning wall almost immediately:

```
Stuck on 2022-10, but it’s moving fast
New deprecation just rolled past
You hold on tight, but it’s time to grow
‘Cause Shopify changes, and you gotta let it go…
```

Our server needed dynamic version resolution, fetching `publicApiVersions` and ensuring compatibility. Then came the bugs – a nasty recursive loop between our version manager and proxy layer brought the server to its knees during testing (`curl` just hung!), requiring careful debugging and refactoring to ensure internal calls bypassed the proxy. Even applying code changes sometimes felt like wrestling a ghost, with diff tools failing mysteriously, forcing us back to basics.

Then came the "plot twists." Mid-development, we discovered Shopify launched their *own* `@shopify/dev-mcp` server! A quick look revealed it was primarily an *informational* tool – great for searching docs and exploring the Admin schema from a local file, but not for *executing* against a live or mock store. Soon after, we noticed Composio's polished, commercial Shopify MCP offering, boasting a long list of (mostly Admin API) tools. The question hit hard: "Why are we rolling our own when this exists?"

> **"In the rush towards AI integration, the critical distinction between informational tools and execution engines can blur. Building your own isn't about reinventing the wheel; it's about forging the specific, controlled pathway your team needs to move safely and effectively."**

The answer lay in revisiting our core purpose. Composio targets live stores, likely with powerful (and risky) Admin API access. The official Shopify tool provides static information. Neither offered the controlled, `mock.shop`-centric sandbox we needed for safe, iterative development and testing. Neither seemed focused on implementing emerging MCP safety features like `ToolAnnotations` (`readonly`, `destructive`, `idempotent`) which are *critical* when allowing an AI to execute actions. Our server wasn't redundant; it filled a specific, crucial gap. We could even envision developers "chaining" the tools – using `@shopify/dev-mcp` to get schema info, then using that info to make precise, validated calls to *our* execution server.

We doubled down on our approach: granular tools, clear annotations, robust error handling, and the `mock.shop` safety net. We implemented Storefront tools (`findCollections`, `getCart`, etc.) and carefully added initial Admin tools (`getCustomerById`, `createProduct`), ensuring each had explicit annotations defining its behavior. This wasn't just about building *an* MCP server; it was about building the *right* one for our specific need: empowering developers safely.

> **"The future isn't just about adopting AI tools, but about shaping them. True 10x productivity emerges when teams integrate AI thoughtfully, building or adapting tools that provide not just capability, but also context, safety, and control aligned with their unique operational realities."**

So, while the MCP landscape is crowded, don't mistake quantity for quality, or generic capability for tailored utility. For tech leads, platform teams, and DTC operators navigating AI integration: look beyond the hype. Assess your *actual* needs, especially around safety, testing, and control. Does that off-the-shelf server *really* align with your workflow? Does it understand `mock.shop`? Does it provide clear safety annotations? Sometimes, the most productive path isn't grabbing the shiniest tool, but intentionally crafting the right one. It's the difference between playing checkers with a generic AI and playing 3D chess with an AI partner you've equipped, trained, and trusted within clear boundaries. Build wisely.
